# Mobius Transformations
This project simply extends Henry Segerman's code for mobius transformations (http://elevr.com/spherical-video-editing-effects-with-mobius-transformations/)
and adapts so that one can create any mobius transformation and see its efects directly over an image online. The code uses webpy to achieve this.

The web page includes some typical transformations, but the user can supply any transformation in the form of a 2x2 complex matrix.

Also, if the image turns out to be of a single color, it is probbale that the supplied transformation is not injective.

Thanks!
